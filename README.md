This is a Kotlin-based Android application that utilizes the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to display data fetched from a REST food API. The app allows users to browse through a variety of meals, view detailed information about each dish, and explore meal categories. Key features include:

API Integration: 

The app fetches meal data, categories, and details from a RESTful food API using Retrofit for seamless network calls.

MVVM Architecture:

Clean separation of concerns is maintained with ViewModels handling UI logic and the Repository pattern managing data sources.

Room Database:

Users can save their favorite meals locally using Room, enabling offline access and data persistence.

Interactive UI:

The app provides smooth navigation between different sections such as meal details, categories, and a BottomSheetDialog to explore categories.

Search and Favorites:

Users can search for meals, add them to favorites, and remove meals from their favorites using intuitive swipe gestures.
This project demonstrates the integration of multiple Android components and libraries, such as Retrofit, Room, LiveData, and ViewModel, to build a scalable and maintainable application.
